## Persistence

**Presentations/Demos:**

## Accessibility Considerations

All color schemes are designed with accessibility in mind:

- Readable in both light and dark modes

## Keyboard Navigation

The theme customizer can be fully navigated with keyboard:
- **Tab** - Move between options
- **Enter/Space** - Select option

## Troubleshooting

**Theme not saving:**
- Check that localStorage is enabled in your browser
- Not in incognito/private mode
- Browser has sufficient storage space

**Colors look wrong:**
- Try refreshing the page
- Clear browser cache
- Check browser zoom level (100% recommended)

**Dark mode too dark:**
- Adjust your screen brightness
- Try Ocean or Lavender schemes for lighter darks

**Light mode too bright:**
- Try adjusting screen brightness
- Use dark mode instead
- Enable night mode/f.lux on your device

## Tips & Tricks

1. **Match Your Environment** - Use dark mode at night, light mode during day
2. **Theme by Topic** - Use different schemes for different subjects/projects
3. **Reduce Eye Strain** - Dark mode with Ocean scheme is easiest on eyes
4. **Professional Presentations** - Stick with Blue or Forest in light mode
5. **Print-Friendly** - Light mode with Blue scheme prints best
6. **Screenshots** - Light mode generally looks better in documentation
